# LadderLink

**LadderLink** is a project that solves the classic Word Ladder problem. This challenge involves transforming one word into another by changing one letter at a time, ensuring that each intermediate step is also a valid word. Inspired by Lewis Carroll's word ladder game, this project determines if a valid word ladder exists between two given words and outputs the ladder if it does.

## How It Works

The core of the project is the `WordLadder` class, which manages the dictionary of available words and performs the ladder generation. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Initialize**: Load the dictionary of words.
2. **Ladder Search**: Use breadth-first search to explore all possible word transformations that differ by one letter.
3. **Track Path**: Store intermediate ladders in stacks and use queues to manage the exploration.
4. **Output**: If a ladder is found, reverse the stack to get the correct order and save the result to a file.

**Example Word Ladder**: 

From "dog" to "cat":

dog -> dot -> dat -> cat.
